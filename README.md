# Weather-Journal App Project

## Overview
1)This project is all about creating an asynchronous web app that uses the Web API of OpenWeatherMap to get the temperature and also uses the user data to dynamically update the UI.

2)When the user enters the ZipCode of an area and his weather feelings about today in that area, the web app responds with today's date, temperature and the user feelings.

## Resources
I reviewed content from udacity's course of Web Apps and asynchronous javascript, also udacity's web webinars helped me to complete the project and make my thinking right towards my steps.
